# iOS Tracker Blocklist

My personal blocklist of iOS tracking, telemetry, and advertising domains.

Made for use with [Disconnect Pro for iOS](https://disconnect.me/) ([App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disconnect-privacy-pro-entire/id1057771839?ls=1&mt=8)), which I highly recommend. It's worth noting that this particular app automatically blocks all subdomains under each domain, unlike a typical `hosts` file. If using another app, prepending wildcards may be required.

[Disconnect Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disconnect-privacy-pro-entire/id1057771839?ls=1&mt=8) also comes preloaded with [Disconnect.me's great blocklist](https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect-tracking-protection). The list in this repository is meant to supplement that list.
